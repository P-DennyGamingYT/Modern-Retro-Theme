# Modern Retro Theme

The official Modern Retro theme is a Better Discord theme based off of the Fallout 4 Terminal theme by Bates, the Dark Matter theme by Tropical, and The Radial Status theme by Gibbu.

This theme is meant to be a modern and retro theme at the same time. Since this is just 3 combined themes it is pretty buggy and some things get cut off the screen or
moved in different ways but this should be fixed soon if I decide to maintain it.

# How to use

To use this theme you must install Better Discord. If you do not know about Better Discord I would suggest watching a YouTube video about it.
The official Better Discord Website link can be found [here](https://betterdiscord.app/).

After installing, open the user settings panel and scroll all the way down to the bottom of the tabs list on the left hand side. Now, open the Themes tab in the Better Discord
section of your settings menu. Then click on the button at the top that says "Open Themes Folder" then drag and drop the downloaded theme to your themes folder.
Now just activate the theme and you're good to go.
